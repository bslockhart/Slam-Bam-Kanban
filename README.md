# Group 5
# Project 2 Slam Bam Kanban

## Description
## Description
Welcome to the Slam Bam Kanban. This application is designed for bootcamp students who will soon be looking for employment. This application was created collaboratively by Group 5 using everything we've learned over the past six weeks; furthermore, this application contains an entirely new templating engine called handlebars.

The Slam Bam Kanban is a MVP that we believe meets all of the criteria for our application. Each member of the group has played a significant role in the development of this application. Our goal is to continue development of this MVP throughout the course. We present the Slam Bam Kanban.

### Project Requirements
* Your project should fulfill the following requirements:
1. Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
2. Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
3. Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
4. Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
5. Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
6. Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
7. Have a polished UI.
8. Be responsive.
9. Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
10. Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
11. Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
12. Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
13. Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
14. Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
15. Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

# Concept
* Given I am user who wants to keep track of job search information.
* When I enter my wishlist.
* Then I am presented with a location to add my dream job.
* Given  I am a user who wants to keep track of applications.
* When I click on applied, I can add current applications.
* Given I am a user who wants to keep track of interviews.
* When I add click the add button, I can enter interview information.
* Given I am a user who wants to keep track of offers.
* When I click add, I can keep view current job offers.

### Presentation Requirements
1. Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.
2. Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
3. Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
4. Demo: Show your stuff!
5. Directions for future development.
6. Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.
